Super simple Figmark demo.

#### Getting started

To get started with this example, first you'll need to update the `personalAccessToken` and `teamId` in figmark.json.

Next, go ahead and run this:

```
npm install
npm run update:design
npm run build
```

At this point the project should have been bundled, so go ahead and
open `dist/index.html`. That's it!
